		 * We will write a program to help users do SOMETHING
		 * You must be able to:
		 * 1. use a method: cls(), title(subtitle)
		 * 2. error trap with try catch {} must use nextLine() to get user input, and parse to integer(or double)
		 * 3. Write a menu ( must include a default) People often lose points for no default or break
		 * 4. Must be able to format a table nicely
		 * 5. given a prompt like "make a converter" we will be given the conversion
		 * DO NOT use a different conversion. Dr. k's may be purposely wrong. USE THE WRONG ONE
